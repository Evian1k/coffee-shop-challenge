# Geometric Sequence Calculator

This project provides a simple program to calculate terms in a geometric sequence given certain conditions, such as specific term values and common ratio. It demonstrates how to solve for the first term and common ratio, then calculate any term in the sequence.

## Features

- Calculate common ratio given two terms.
- Calculate first term based on the common ratio.
- Compute any term in the geometric sequence.
- Example included: finding first 4 terms given \(T_3 = 1\) and \(T_6 = \frac{1}{27}\).

## Usage

1. Define the known terms of the geometric sequence.
2. Use the formulas to calculate the common ratio and first term.
3. Calculate the desired terms.
4. The program can be adapted to other similar problems.

## Example

Given:
- \(T_3 = 1\)
- \(T_6 = \frac{1}{27}\)

The program calculates:
- Common ratio \(r = \frac{1}{3}\)
- First term \(a = 9\)
- First 4 terms: 9, 3, 1, \(\frac{1}{3}\)
